server configuration
====================

Instructions for setting up a web server. These specific instructions were 
developed for a rackspace cloud server running Ubuntu 12.4, but they should
work in general for any Debian/Ubuntu version with any host.

For the initial setup (e.g. new client) go through the instruction in 
[Initial-Setup.md](https://github.com/Brunello/server-configuration/blob/master/Initial-Setup.md) first then install LAMP and other miscilaneous packages by
following the instructions in [Install-LAMP.md](https://github.com/Brunello/server-configuration/blob/master/Install-LAMP.md).

For each site that will be hosted on the server, use the instructions in 
[Add-Site.md](https://github.com/Brunello/server-configuration/blob/master/Add-Site.md). You can also find general mysql and apache instructions in this
file.

> These instruction use vi in commands where a text editor is required. You can
> substitute the text editor of your choice where applicable, but it is much 
> easier to learn and use basic vi commands as vi will allow you to search the 
> contents of files for the strings you need to replace.
