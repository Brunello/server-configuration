server configuration
====================

Instructions for setting up a web server. These specific instructions were 
developed for a rackspace cloud server running Ubuntu 12.4, but they should
work in general for any Debian/Ubuntu version with any host.

For the initial setup (e.g. new client) go through the instruction in 
`Initial-Setup.md` first then install LAMP and other miscilaneous packages by
following the instructions in `Install-LAMP.md`.

For each site that will be hosted on the server, use the instructions in 
`Add-Site.md`. You can also find general mysql and apache instructions in this
file.
